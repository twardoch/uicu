# uicu Implementation Plan - v0.2.0 to v1.0

## Executive Summary

The `uicu` project has successfully implemented core Unicode functionality with PyICU wrappers. Based on the development status and existing streamlining plan, this document outlines the path from the current v0.2.0-dev state to a streamlined v1.0 MVP release that focuses on reliability and performance.

## Current State (v0.2.0-dev)

### ✅ Successfully Implemented

1. **Character Properties** - Complete Unicode character analysis (95% coverage)
2. **Locale Management** - BCP 47 compliant handling (90% coverage)
3. **Collation & Sorting** - Culture-aware comparison (95% coverage)
4. **Text Segmentation** - All break types working (90% coverage)
5. **Transliteration** - Basic functionality (80% coverage)
6. **Date/Time Formatting** - Formatting works, parsing broken (60% coverage)

### ⚠️ Issues Requiring Fixes

1. **src/uicu/uicu.py** - Already removed (placeholder file deleted)
2. **DateTimeFormatter parsing** - Returns 1970 dates (millisecond bug)
3. **Transliterator transform IDs** - Some IDs incorrect
4. **Multi-codepoint handling** - Can't handle flag emojis in Char class
5. **Exception over-engineering** - Too many custom exceptions

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

1. **Sphinx documentation** - Not set up
2. **Performance benchmarks** - Not created
3. **CI/CD pipeline** - Not configured

## Streamlining Analysis

### Code Quality Issues

1. **Excessive Exception Wrapping**
   - Every module wraps ICU exceptions unnecessarily
   - Loses valuable error context
   - Adds ~5 lines for every 1 line of functionality

2. **Verbose Documentation**
   - Docstrings repeat type hints
   - Explain obvious parameters
   - Multi-paragraph explanations for simple functions

3. **Redundant Validation**
   - Locale validation in every class
   - Character validation repeated
   - Strength validation duplicated

4. **Demo Script Issues**
   - Interactive input() calls break automation
   - Try-except blocks hide real errors
   - Hardcoded mappings duplicate functionality

5. **Import Inefficiencies**
   - Importing entire modules for one constant
   - Multiple conditional imports
   - Complex import error handling

## v1.0 MVP Strategy

### Core Principles

1. **Reliability First** - Only ship features that work 100%
2. **Performance Focus** - <5% overhead vs raw PyICU
3. **Minimal Surface** - Fewer classes, more functions
4. **Clear Errors** - Let ICU errors provide context
5. **Small & Fast** - <100KB package, <100ms imports

### Keep for v1.0 (Working Features)

| Feature | Status | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Character Properties | ✅ Works | Fix multi-codepoint handling |
| Collation/Sorting | ✅ Works | Keep as-is |
| Text Segmentation | ✅ Works | Keep as-is |
| Transliteration | ⚡ Partial | Fix transform IDs |
| Locale Management | ✅ Works | Keep as-is |
| Date Formatting | ⚡ Partial | Keep formatting, remove parsing |

### Remove for v1.0 (Defer/Delete)

| Feature | Reason | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| DateTimeFormatter.parse() | Broken (1970 bug) | Delete method |
| NumberFormatter | Not implemented | Defer to v2.0 |
| ListFormatter | Not implemented | Defer to v2.0 |
| MessageFormatter | Not implemented | Defer to v2.0 |
| Field position tracking | Stub code | Delete |
| Relative time formatting | Stub code | Delete |
| Interactive demo | Breaks automation | Make scriptable |

## Implementation Plan (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Fix DateTimeFormatter.parse() or remove it entirely (never implemented, no action needed)
- [x] Fix transliterator transform IDs (Issue #202 - added find_transforms() helper)
- [x] Fix multi-codepoint handling in Char class (documented limitation with helpful errors)
- [x] Remove all TODO stub comments from format.py (none found)

### Phase 2: Code Cleanup (Week 2) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Simplify exception handling across all modules
- [x] Remove excessive try-except wrapping
- [x] Clean up verbose docstrings
- [x] Optimize imports (conditional imports all well-justified)
- [x] Make demo script non-interactive (already was non-interactive)
- [x] Remove hardcoded category mappings from demo

### Phase 3: API Simplification (Week 3) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Consolidate duplicate validation code
- [x] Reduce custom exceptions usage (removed unnecessary wrapping)
- [x] Remove field position tracking stubs
- [x] Remove broken DateTimeFormatter.parse() method
- [x] Clean up dead code and unused imports
- [ ] Move constants inline where appropriate
- [ ] Make internal classes private (_prefixed)

### Phase 4: Documentation & Testing (Week 4)

- [ ] Set up Sphinx with modern theme (Furo)
- [ ] Auto-generate API documentation from docstrings
- [ ] Write user guides for common use cases
- [ ] Create cookbook with real-world examples
- [ ] Set up automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Update tests for streamlined API
- [ ] Remove tests for deleted features
- [ ] Update README for v1.0 features
- [ ] Create migration guide from v0.2 to v1.0
- [ ] Final performance testing

## Success Metrics

### v1.0 Target Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Impact |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Test Coverage | ~80% | >95% | Higher reliability |
| Import Time | ~150ms | <100ms | Faster startup |
| Package Size | ~150KB | <100KB | Smaller footprint |
| Core Code Lines | ~3000 | <2000 | Easier maintenance |
| PyICU Overhead | ~10% | <5% | Better performance |
| Working Features | 90% | 100% | No broken features |

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Exception Classes**: 6 → 3 (50% reduction)
- **Import Complexity**: High → Low
- **Docstring Verbosity**: 40% reduction
- **Validation Duplication**: Eliminated
- **Dead Code**: 0 lines

## Migration Path

### From v0.2.0-dev to v1.0

1. **Breaking Changes**
   - DateTimeFormatter.parse() removed
   - Some exception classes consolidated
   - Internal classes made private
   
2. **API Improvements**
   - Cleaner function signatures
   - Better error messages
   - Consistent naming

3. **Performance Gains**
   - Faster imports
   - Lower memory usage
   - Direct PyICU access where beneficial

## Post-v1.0 Roadmap (v1.1+)

### v1.1 - Enhanced Features

- NumberFormatter for currency, percentages, scientific notation
- ListFormatter for proper locale-aware list joining
- MessageFormatter for complex pluralization
- Advanced timezone handling
- Bulk processing APIs

### v1.2 - Ecosystem Integration

- Django integration
- pandas Unicode extension
- FastAPI i18n plugin

## Conclusion

The path to v1.0 focuses on delivering a reliable, performant Unicode library by:

1. Fixing all broken features or removing them
2. Streamlining the codebase for maintainability
3. Optimizing for performance and size
4. Ensuring 100% of shipped features work correctly

This approach prioritizes quality over quantity, resulting in a focused tool that excels at core Unicode operations.
