# unicode-wrapper-implementation

## Core Wrapper Components 

1. Character Property Facade (Importance: 95)
```python
class UnicodeChar:
    """Provides unified access to character properties across ICU and fontTools"""
    def get_properties(self):
        # Combines data from both sources with fontTools as primary
        # Falls back to ICU for missing properties
```

2. Script Detection System (Importance: 90)
```python
class ScriptDetector:
    def detect_scripts(self, text):
        # Filters common/inherited scripts
        # Returns ISO 15924 codes with extensions
        # Handles mixed-script content
```

3. Locale Management (Importance: 85)
```python
class LocaleWrapper:
    """Thread-safe locale context manager"""
    def __enter__(self):
        # Saves current locale state
        # Activates requested locale
        
    def __exit__(self):
        # Restores previous locale
```

4. Text Segmentation Interface (Importance: 80)
```python
class BreakIterator:
    """Language-aware text boundary detection"""
    def get_boundaries(self, text, boundary_type):
        # Detects word/sentence/line breaks
        # Considers writing system rules
```

Critical File Paths:
- src/uicu/char.py: Character property wrapping
- src/uicu/unicode/script.py: Script detection implementation  
- src/uicu/locale/context.py: Locale management
- src/uicu/break/iterator.py: Text segmentation

The wrapper implementation focuses on providing Pythonic interfaces while preserving full access to ICU's internationalization capabilities. Key aspects include:

- Unified property access across data sources
- Thread-safe locale handling
- Writing system awareness
- Clean Python integration
