# uicu Development Status Report

*Last Updated: 2025-01-25*

## Executive Summary

The `uicu` package provides a Pythonic wrapper around PyICU, making Unicode text processing and internationalization accessible to Python developers. The project has successfully implemented core functionality including character properties, locale management, collation, segmentation, and transliteration. A partial implementation of date/time formatting is available, though parsing needs fixes.

## Current Version: 0.2.0-dev

### What Works Well ✅

1. **Character Properties** - Full Unicode character analysis
   - Name, category, script, block lookup
   - Numeric values, bidirectional properties
   - Integration with fontTools for latest Unicode data

2. **Locale Management** - BCP 47 compliant locale handling
   - Parse and validate locale identifiers
   - Factory pattern for creating locale-specific services
   - Access to 700+ locales

3. **Collation & Sorting** - Culture-aware string comparison
   - Multiple strength levels
   - Numeric sorting (2 < 10)
   - Direct integration with Python's sorted()

4. **Text Segmentation** - Unicode-compliant boundary detection
   - Grapheme clusters (user-perceived characters)
   - Word boundaries with locale rules
   - Sentence detection with abbreviation handling

5. **Transliteration** - Script conversion and transforms
   - Working transforms: Cyrillic-Latin, Greek-Latin, etc.
   - Case transformations
   - Normalization forms (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD)

6. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Comprehensive README with examples
   - 12-demo example script covering all features
   - Detailed CHANGELOG
   - Clear development roadmap

### Known Issues ⚠️

1. **DateTimeFormatter Parsing**
   - Returns incorrect dates (1970 epoch)
   - Milliseconds interpreted as seconds
   - Complex parsing not implemented

2. **Transliteration**
   - Some transform IDs incorrect (e.g., "Russian-Latin")
   - No way to list available transforms
   - Poor error messages

3. **Character Properties**
   - Can't handle multi-codepoint strings (flag emojis)
   - Missing convenient functions at module level

### Not Yet Implemented ❌

1. **Formatting Components**
   - NumberFormatter (decimal, currency, percent)
   - ListFormatter (locale-aware list joining)
   - MessageFormatter (plurals, gender selection)

2. **Documentation**
   - No Sphinx setup
   - No API reference docs
   - No tutorials

3. **Infrastructure**
   - No performance benchmarks
   - No CI/CD setup
   - Test coverage at ~80%

## Development Metrics

| Component | Status | Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Character Properties | ✅ Complete | 95% | Single codepoint only |
| Locale Management | ✅ Complete | 90% | All major features |
| Collation | ✅ Complete | 95% | Full functionality |
| Segmentation | ✅ Complete | 90% | All break types |
| Transliteration | ⚡ Partial | 80% | Transform ID issues |
| Date Formatting | ⚡ Partial | 60% | Parsing broken |
| Number Formatting | ❌ Not Started | 0% | Issue #103 |
| List Formatting | ❌ Not Started | 0% | Issue #104 |
| Message Formatting | ❌ Not Started | 0% | Issue #105 |

## Issue Tracking

### Open Issues
- **#102**: DateTimeFormatter - Partially complete, parsing needs fixes
- **#103**: NumberFormatter - Not started
- **#104**: ListFormatter - Not started
- **#105**: MessageFormatter - Not started
- **#106**: Documentation - Sphinx setup needed
- **#107**: Performance Benchmarks - Not started
- **#202**: Fix Transliterator Transform IDs - New issue

### Closed Issues
- **#101**: Linting issues - Fixed
- **#108**: Example scripts - Completed with uicu_demo.py
- **#201**: Demo script bugs - Fixed

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (This Week)
1. Fix DateTimeFormatter parsing bug
2. Document available transliterator transforms
3. Handle multi-codepoint strings in Char class

### Short Term (v0.2.0 - Next Month)
1. Implement NumberFormatter
2. Implement ListFormatter
3. Set up Sphinx documentation
4. Reach 90% test coverage

### Medium Term (v0.3.0 - Next Quarter)
1. Performance benchmarks
2. MessageFormatter implementation
3. CI/CD with GitHub Actions
4. Property-based testing

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Critical Bugs First** - The DateTimeFormatter parsing bug makes the feature unusable for bidirectional conversion.

2. **Document Limitations** - Be clear about what doesn't work (e.g., flag emojis) and provide workarounds.

3. **Focus on Core Formatters** - NumberFormatter and ListFormatter are essential for i18n applications.

4. **Set Up CI Early** - Automated testing will catch regressions as the codebase grows.

5. **Engage Community** - The comprehensive demo script can attract early adopters who can provide feedback.

## Conclusion

The uicu project has made excellent progress in providing Pythonic access to ICU's Unicode capabilities. The core functionality is solid and well-tested. The main gaps are in the formatting module and documentation infrastructure. With focused effort on the immediate priorities, the package could reach a stable v0.2.0 release within a month.
